## Feedback
Product
- Lots of good ideas presented with supporting reasons, but minimal explanation of the partner’s goals. The reader must read between the lines to understand what AAH’s end goals are/what they are about and what their current issues are.
- Users section is brief. As this is a social media platform, the different user types will interact with one another; tell the reader more about the details of these interactions. 
- Administrator mentioned later as user but not in Target Users.

Plan
- Roles and Responsibilities would benefit from formatting to increase readability
- Goals and Tasks are well divided and continue to be broken down into subgoals that lend themselves to development tasks.

Overall Quality
- Please put the deliverable documents into a deliverables folder at the top level of your repo so that they are easy to find.
- Frequent grammatical irregularities take away from strength of the documents.
