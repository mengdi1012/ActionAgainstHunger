Product
- Achieves MVP for client. 

README.md
- Note that the deliverable documents were submitted late and so the last commit before 2019-03-31 23:59 was used.
- Cannot sign up a new student, so I cannot test notifications. Provided student credentials do not work. 

plan.md
- Note that the deliverable documents were submitted late and so the last commit before 2019-03-31 23:59 was used.
- Good to see the team is has made considerations after the git issues experienced during D2. Same for addressing feedback given for D2.

review.md
- Note that the deliverable documents were submitted late and so the last commit before 2019-03-31 23:59 was used.
- Again, good to see the team thinking about git security/accidents. But, how could the team _make sure_ that code is not lost? Offsite/non-Git backups are an option. Disabling pushing to master without a PR is another.
