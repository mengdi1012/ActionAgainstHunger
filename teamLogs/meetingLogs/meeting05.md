Log:	
* Safety purpose, students are not allowed to create own account, only provided by teachers.
* Food professionals should be separated from teachers (like guest only post some blogs)
* Teacher could set up a contest, allocating access code to the students
* School scope
* Students are pre-approved by teachers
* Safety reason, anonymous , not real information
* More interactions
* Profile: attribute of school
* Badge of achievements for students
* We want to connect different schools with each other (eg compare learning objectives between different schools) 
* Teacher could post a challenge, students can post and discussion... 
* We want to keep students engaged (maybe competing schools?)
* We want to keep students and teachers on board by demonstrating value to both groups
* Eg. for teachers we want them to be able to provide learnable moments to students
* We should also consider an easy to use interface for teachers so they are more likely to stay on board
* Stay on board , points to real rewards - for students/teachers
* Posts shared spread in all schools
* Set up 
* filter of posts by categories, authors, dates…
* Hashtag for each post
* public/private, questions 
* ***Think about value!!!***
* Another interesting project: Map things
