Notes:


Hi Karine,
We have a new idea about the project. We find that a web application is more suitable for your current needs rather than adding features to the existing android app.
Here are the reasons:
It is painful to post/type long articles on the phone
It is hard for the admin to manage all the users, posts and stuff on the phone
A web application can be designed to fit different sizes of devices (it’s called Responsive Design, here is a link for explaination on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). It does not have any device restrictions (meaning the web app can be used on any device).
We have strong experience in Web Application development, we can build a totally free product(i.e free database) with a pleasant user experience.
We understand the value of an android app. We just want to provide a more user friendly product for your organization quickly. A mobile app can be developed in the future based on this web application, similar to how the Facebook mobile app resembles the Facebook website. Let us know your opinion on this idea.

Thank you,
Hunger Team



Hi Karine,

Yes, you are correct. The web application have the same features as the Android app and will be expanded more features like reward system and notifications from the post when users are tagged. Some of our team members have strong web development background. It would not be much harder than building an app from scratch than expanding based on last semester’s app since there is no proper documentation on last semester’s team. We will keep the Android app from last semester for future use. After the web app is built, we could transplant the web app to the android app if we have time.  All data will be shared between the web version and the android version. The code from last semester will be used during the process.

Thank you,
Hunger Team
