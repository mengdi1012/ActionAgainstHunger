#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

Communications:
A:
The team communicates among each other using a group chat in facebook and wechat . There are at least 2 regular group meeting. Both meetings are held in a study room. For the first meeting, it is encouraged to attend in person but facebook video chat is fine as well. The second meeting needs everyone to attend in person. 

The group wants to meet with partner biweekly by person or using skype dso that the team can make sure the project processes in a correct way.  Before the meeting, the group will prepare a list of questions and accomplishments using Google Doc and share it to each other. In this way, as a team, we can adjust our project based on our partner’s opinions and suggestions. 

 
Meetings:
A: We hold two meetings every week and each meeting has a designated chair (different person every meeting). Every team member will be given tasks that they will be responsible for completing and reporting on in the meetings. This way we can ensure that the team is on track and each member has a precise idea of what is happening. Attendance is recorded for every meeting so that the team can see if there is anyone that is frequently absent. Those that do not regularly attend meetings will have to talk to the team to figure out possible solutions.
 
Conflict Resolution:
A:
  1. Some team member is not answering any of the emails or texts.
	I will try to meet that team member in person and remind him/her with polite that I had sent an email and wait for the reply. If we can’t find the person, I will leave a voice message in case the member is in an area that has poor signal connection so that the member can reply back when he/she can. Also, I will send another text message and tell him/her: “I’ll follow up tomorrow and if you need help or you have an urgency, do not hesitate to contact me by this number.” 
	The team will choose one member to represent our group to contact with the member with our team’s caring and love. The team should ask why the member is not responding.
  2. A team member has not finish the work on their deadline.
	We can make an internal deadline for each iteration (3 days before the real deadline). Therefore if a team member has some difficulties or urgency to complete the task, as team, we can try to solve it together or ask TA for help. In that case we will have enough time to handle the unexpected situation.  
  3. A team member/entire team has disagree with everything you say.
	Firstly,I will ensure if all other members understand my opinions clearly.  Besides, I will be a good listener to the reasons of disagreement and ask for suggestions to solve it. Since everyone has different experiences and thinkings, I will try to think in their positions. In addition, always keep calm and think for the benefit of the team even when your idea been denied. However, if I think that other team members focus on my personal characters rather than the issues, I will ask for help from TA.
  4. Everyone agrees with everything everyone says.
	We should encourage all team members not to be shy and feel free to express different opinions. Tell them that speaking different is not judging others but provide a chance for a better idea. To get all team members been involved, we can ask all the team members write down their ideas on a piece of paper in anonymously. After gathering and discussing all ideas, each team member is supposed to vote their best option along with explanation by turns. Together Based on voting, we determine the final idea.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
A:
We will be having meetings twice a week, every week. These meetings will be in-person, those that are unable to attend in person may join through a skype video call.  The purpose of the first meeting is to discuss what needs to be done and assign action items. This ensures that every member of the team knows what they are responsible for. The first meeting of the week will generally be around an hour in length and will usually be on a Tuesday or Wednesday. The second meeting will be the longer meeting typically lasting around 2 hours. This meeting is meant for going over the assigned action items for that week and reviewing progress. Each member will be responsible for completing their action items before the second meeting so that each person can discuss their part and the team can analyze the product as a whole. If there is any confusion or troublesome problems with the source code, the second half of this meeting may be used as a coding session/code review. We chose to follow this “Scrum” methodology because it is efficient, organized and every member is comfortable with this type of schedule.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       
A:
To remain organized, our biggest tool will be using a scrum sheet (using an Excel document)  that our weekly/biweekly tasks. Each task will also contain priorities for the task. The scrum sheet will help us keep track of our individual tasks for each sprint and which tasks are most important. Our scrum sheet will consist of two different types of sheets. The first sheet is a weekly/biweekly sprint schedule for the entire semester. This sheet will provide us an idea of the bigger focuses of the week (such as completing a whole feature). It tells us our goals for each week so we know where we should be at weekly/biweekly. The second sheet will be to indicate our progress for each week. For each goal in the first sheet, we will separate it into smaller subtasks and determine each subtask for each individual member. This will help organize our day-to-day-progress. 
There are different ways we can allocate tasks for teammates. One way is to split this team into smaller teams and have each team focus on one part of the speciality. This would help us, since specializing would help us be more focused on our tasks. For example we can split the team into frontend and backend. Or we can also split the team based on features, such as one group works on authentication and others work on the quiz feature. 
Github issues and pull requests can help us keep track on whose working on what issues. It also provides us opportunity to leave comments on separate issues so we can stay organized with our thoughts. For example, one issue can be on frontend for the login page and another could be a possible bug. By having two separate issues, any thoughts on the frontend would not be mixed with any opinions on the bug.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks
Here are a few of the key goals that we discussed:
1. Identify the 4 types of intended user and assign different permissions for them for better management and security of personal information:
	- Students: anonymous account,  Invited to login Make posts/View posts/Comment on posts. 
	  Can’t create account or change their username for safety reason.
	- Teachers: create a pool of users for students, Post educational information/news 
	 (Possibly with pictures and embedded videos)
	- Professionals: login, publish posts and answer questions.
	- Admin:  Create accounts for teachers and food professionals, view all the users 
	  information, edit posts, etc.
2.  The interactions among users:
    - A strong focus on posting images, texts and reading/commenting on others’ posts so that 
      users can interact with others.
    - receive notification when users are tagged from the post so that user can easily follow 
      the ongoing communication. For example, students attend activities for growing tomatoes, 
      post their tomatoes’ photos, and receive feedback and comment from their peers.
    - Ask questions and invite nutrition experts to provide professional answers.
3.  "gamifying" food education to increase student interest and retention
	- Providing challenges for students and and rewarding systems to let students gain the sense
	  of achievement
The security of personal information privacy is the most important part of the project. Users’ privacy is the most important thing, especially for the students, their safety is needed to be protected cautiously. The second most important goal is to allow user-interactions. One of the main goal of the organization is to share knowledge and connect students and teachers across Canada on food science to reduce the victim of food insecurity. It is a way to interactively learn knowledge and communicate with users across Canada. “Gamifying” food education is the least important feature because the organization wants to engage students staying on using the application with the knowledge of nutrition science in a global scope but not something else.


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.
A:
Firstly, our main artifact is building the website, uploading it, and deploying it such that it is publicly accessible to users. The purpose of this artifact is that this is our end goal and what we wanted to create. It is useful for our team and users to have a publicly accessible website to test and use in production. By having a deployed website, this will help the client with their goals which is creating connections with students and having then learn from health-related professionals and each other.
There are other artifacts which are useful from a developer’s perspective. 
Another main artifact is using UML diagrams and drawing database models. This would help us describe the relationships between different objects and would provide us a clearer and well defined understanding of the object classes and the relationships among them. If future teams want to take over our codebase, this would help them understand where we left off as well.
Another artifact which is useful is having a wiki for the application and making it publicly accessible. This would allow us to well document all the features for users and developers to understand. 
Finally we can provide video tutorials of the applications that shows them how to use the features we implemented it to reduce any learning curve for them. We can have videos demonstrating features such as the gamification feature and how to register new students in a class.
