## Iteration XX

 * Start date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FIRST TEAM PLANNING MEETING
Feb 14
 * End date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE YOUR REVIEW MEETING
March 09

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction
We strictly follow the Scrum methodology to proceed with the development.

#### Changes from previous iteration

* Discuss more features together rather than splitting into groups in meetings.
  * Since we split up into smaller teams to work on specific features, it is often the case that some members from one team don't know what is going on with a feature that another group is working on. To combat this we have decided to have an open discussion for every feature in meetings so that everyone understands what is going on and what will be done.

* Put multiple members on broad features instead of allocating it to one person
  * This way there is room for more creativity. Certain broad tasks like the user's home page, profile page can have multiple different ways of being designed. Having more than one person working on it allows for more flexibility as well as efficiency. Hopefully by implementing this, these sort of tasks will be done quicker with better results and better functionality.

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

The team communicates with each other using a group chat in facebook and Wechat. There are at least 2 regular group meetings. Both meetings are held in a study room. For the first meeting, it is encouraged to attend in person but facebook video chat is fine as well. The second meeting needs everyone to attend in person.

The group wants to meet with the partner biweekly in person or using skype so that the team can make sure the project processes in a correct way.  Before the meeting, the group will prepare a list of questions and accomplishments using Google Doc and share it with each other. In this way, as a team, we can adjust our project based on our partner’s opinions and suggestions.

###### Meetings:
Every week, each member is assigned tasks to be completed for the end of the week. Each person’s task is recorded and they are expected to discuss their progress on their tasks during the end of the weekly meeting. Each member is expected to complete the given tasks and/or bring up any problems/troubles they are experiencing during their work. There is a moderator for each meeting who is responsible for starting the discussion for each task as well as speaking with the person responsible for that task. Attendance for each meeting is recorded and members who cannot attend meetings will be asked to inform the team 24 hours before the meeting. The team also frequently uses a facebook group chat to have reminders about meeting times, discussions about progress as well as confirming attendance.

###### Conflict Resolution:
A team member is not answering any of the emails or texts.
We will try to meet that team member in person and remind him/her politely that an email had been sent the team is waiting for the reply. If we can’t find the person, a voice message will be sent in case the member is in an area that has a poor signal connection so that the member can reply back when he/she can. Also, a follow-up text will be sent saying something like: “I’ll follow up tomorrow and if you need help or you have an urgency, do not hesitate to contact me by this number.” The team should ask why the member is not responding.
 A team member has not finished the work on their deadline.
We can make an internal deadline for each iteration (3 days before the real deadline). Therefore if a team member has some difficulties or urgency to complete the task, as a team, we can try to solve it together or ask TA for help. In that case, we will have enough time to handle an unexpected situation.
A team member/entire team has disagreements with everything you say.
Firstly, I will ensure if all other members understand my opinions clearly.  Besides, I will be a good listener to the reasons of disagreement and ask for suggestions to solve it. Since everyone has different experiences and thinkings, I will try to think in their positions. In addition, always keep calm and think for the benefit of the team even when your idea been denied. However, if I think that other team members focus on my personal characters rather than the issues, I will ask for help from the TA.
Everyone agrees with everything everyone says.
We should encourage all team members not to be shy and feel free to express different opinions. Tell them that think differently is not judging others but provide a chance for a better idea. To get all team members been involved, we can ask all the team members write down their ideas on a piece of paper in anonymously. After gathering and discussing all ideas, each team member is supposed to vote their best option along with an explanation by turns. Together based on voting, we determine the final idea.


#### Events
We will be having meetings twice a week, every week. These meetings will be in-person, those that are unable to attend in person may join through a Skype video call.  The purpose of the first meeting is to discuss what needs to be done and assign action items. This ensures that every member of the team knows what they are responsible for. The first meeting of the week will generally be around an hour in length and will usually be on a Tuesday or Wednesday. The second meeting will be the longer meeting typically lasting around 2 hours. This meeting is meant for going over the assigned action items for that week and reviewing progress. Each member will be responsible for completing their action items before the second meeting so that each person can discuss their part and the team can analyze the product as a whole. If there is any confusion or troublesome problems with the source code, the second half of this meeting may be used as a coding session/code review. We chose to follow this “Scrum” methodology because it is efficient, organized and every member is comfortable with this type of schedule.


#### Artifacts
To remain organized, we initially used a scrum sheet (using an Excel document) to plan our weekly/biweekly tasks. However, we realized that it was overkill for our assignment since our tasks were easy to remember and appoint to. Instead, we split the group into smaller teams so that they could each focus on their role. Then each smaller team decided what needed to be done while communicating with the other teams for any requirements they needed for their task. We prioritized tasks by giving each team one major focus they had to complete. For example, one group had to complete authentication and another had to complete the forum. After these major tasks were completed for each group, then we would decide to enrich the application. Priority was based on the impact the task had on users and our objective with the app. For example, if one member was responsible for the view post feed as well as the user profile page, priority would be given to the posts feature because one of our main goals with this app is to allow users to communicate with one another through posts. Teams were made by their assigning people to their biggest strengths or a stronger member with a weaker member. If members in the group had little knowledge of most technologies, they were partnered up with the most knowledgeable to that their inexperience would minimize any delays, whilst still be able to learn. People with some knowledge were partnered together so they could both be able to contribute and learn from each other.


#### Deployment and Github Workflow - feel free to make contributions

We did not use a very strict Git workflow, we only require everyone to remind the whole team on facebook before submitting some critical features.  The first reason is that we split the tasks by features, so there should not be too much code conflict. Besides, we have a tight timeline and everyone’s working time is different, it is very inefficient to wait for others’ review before commit.
In practice, we ask everyone to commit frequently and pull frequently to avoid serious conflict happening. Besides, every time we find an issue caused by some submit, the founder should report the issue to the code owner to fix it in time. We also require everyone to make the commit comment short and clear to help us debugging if needed.
For the development process, we first select a guy to build the architecture for our app in one week.  Then we split all team into sub-teams by features. Everyone develops for their assigned features. Before the internal deadline, the guy building the architecture will integrate all features together. He will get to know everyone’s task achievement and coding details, link the pages together and deploy it on Heroku.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

For this iteration, the team is hoping to complete most if not all features that we set out to complete in the initial planning phase. We are mainly looking to improve usability in this iteration.

Currently the tasks to complete are :
1. Make it easier for users to go from one post to another.
2. Allow users to comment on posts
3. Allow users to navigate through the different categories of posts(Q&A, Articles, Challenges)
4. Allow users to attach pictures with their posts.

These tasks are ranked from most to least important.
