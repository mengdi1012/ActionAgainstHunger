Product
- View post links to a broken page. "Cannot GET..."
- Can log into any student accounts via README credentials or making a new account.
- Overall the product does make progress towards a solution for the problem at hand. However, the application can be slightly confusing at times which hinders usability. Hopefully this will be a focus for D3.
- ~No means of easily testing out the Android app. Not deployed. No activity since Feb. 27.~
- ~`ng serve` did not work for `project-team-06/applications/Frontend/action-against-hunger`. Not deployed.~
- ~I was able to `npm start` the `project-team-06/applications/WebApp` but nothing other than the sign-in page appears. Other routes crash. Effectively not working. Requires technical knowledge to test.~
- ~Team must contact the TAs and setup a time to demo the application for an accurate grade as well as provide the deliverable documents.~

README.md
- Answering the "what is the problem..." question with another question does not really answer the question. This is what the team is supposed to have brainstorm'd on in D1 and delivered partially for D2. I understand that the goal is "to build connections..." however how will that be done? More so, why is this a problem anyways? Why can't they just email each other, use a FB group, etc? Finally the "why" suggests there are privacy and safety concerns that need to be solved but this is not completely clear from the "what" question above it.
- Instructions are okay but could gain clarity from some additional formatting to differentiate the various user flows. 
- Could be a more consistent mapping from Features to Instructions. 
- ~I am unable to find this file in the `deliverables` folder on master as specified in the instructions for D2. I also looked at all Active branches on GitHub and all other branches are behind master, asides from the D1 mark which is only Adam submitting the marks. I was also unable to find anything which followed the expected format in root or `applications/`. All other root directories have not had any updates for 26+ days.~

plan.md
- Process - Artifacts needs to identify how a new member would decide whether one task is more of a priority than another. Typically this is explained by referencing back to the problem and users.
- All of *Product* is missing. 
- Poor document formatting makes reading and understanding difficult.
